I can't upload the dumb data here into my repo because it takes up 199 GB of disk space. 
You know that Github doesn't support such large files.

If you want to experiment with the program then you have to download the files manually and put them into the dumbData folder. 
It is important that you consider the structure of the project. 
Try to keep the same structure as on the Github repo.

Link for the dataDumb files.
